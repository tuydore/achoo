# **ACHOO!** ü§ß

Achoo is an acronym chooser, designed to help find real words that are suitable acronyms for your project's name.

Achoo uses *phrases* instead of words: a phrase is a sequence of ASCII alphabetic words (optionally separated by spaces), where some of the letters are capitalized. These letters make up your acronym. For example, `"Company"` will match the letter `c`, but `"COmpany"` will match the sequence `co` and `"Company Name"` will match the sequence `cn` instead of the individual comprising letters.

Achoo also provides additional features, such as:

- strict matching of the start and end of the acroynm using `--start` and `--end` flags
- wildcards
- printing out the matched sequence of phrases for each acroynm, to help visualize what other words might fit the wildcards

By default, `achoo` tries to pick up the [words file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix)) on UNIX systems. On Windows, you will have to supply your own.
